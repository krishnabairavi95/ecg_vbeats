# ecg_vbeats
ECG Image Processing challenge  

A health tech company gave me a challenge:  Given a collection of ECG strip images, find the location of V-beat in each image.  The ECG plot records a V-beat during a premature ventricular contraction in the heartbeat. 

I have included train and test example images, the question mark labels in test images are the ones that need to be predicted; basically, the V labels alone needs to be returned and it's a binary classification task. Majority of the work was in pre-processing and arriving at the signal

The model can be further advanced by using CNN's.
